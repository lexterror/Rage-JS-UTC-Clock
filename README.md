To change daylight savings time simply left-click on the clock. If you would like the clock to start with DST enabled or disabled change this line:

var goffset = 1;       

to either 1 or 0 ("rageclockutc.html")

To change default city change the following line in the file "rageclockutc.html"

<option value="-5" selected>New York </option>  

Remove the word "selected" and paste it to any other city.
